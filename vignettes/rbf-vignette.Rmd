The `ReplicationBF` package for R allows users to easily compute Replication
Bayes Factors for two common scenarios. @Verhagen2014 introduced
this approach to evaluate and quantify the outcome of a replication study within
a Bayesian hypothesis testing framework.

The original proposed method considered one and two sample t-Tests, which is
implemented in the `RBF_ttest` function.

An extension to F-tests is available in the `RBF_Ftest` function.

Please refer to @Verhagen2014 und @Harms2016 for details until this vignette is
finished.
